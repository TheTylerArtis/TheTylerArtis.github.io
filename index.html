        <h2>My very first coding attempt</h2>
        <p>The collapse of the Soviet Union also heralded the decline of the sanatoria. Under capitalism, the palaces for the proletariat were no longer profitable. Today, valiant attempts are being made to preserve the sanatoria in their original state. They remain fully booked year round. Workers arrive in the summer; retired and infirm employees fill up the rest of the seasons. It is a hopeless cause, however. The often poorly constructed buildings are too large to be maintained with the paltry income generated by the guests. Most Russians with a little more money to spend stay in private hotels or fly to Turkey, Egypt and beyond. While the sanatoria’s patrons lament the visible decay, the managers bemoan the fact that their palaces are not yet five-star facilities. But who knows? The International Olympic Committee was lured to Sochi for these facilities and this spa history, and the Olympic bidbook, which contains the promises made by the candidate city, lists a number of sanatoria as accommodation for guests and athletes – following extensive refurbishment.</p>
