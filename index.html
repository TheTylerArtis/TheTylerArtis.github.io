              <p><i>Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender are one of the coolest couples in Hollywood: Not only are they both really, really, ridiculously talented, with both an Oscar win (her) and nomination (him), but they’d sooner die before tipping off a paparazzo to their arrival at a restaurant.</i></p>

                <h3><strong>Random Vogue Shit</strong></h3>

                   <p>Vikander told reporters that before signing on for The Light Between Oceans, the film they fell in love on, “I knew that Michael was attached to play Tom, and I think he’s one of the most brilliant actors out there . . . I was up for the game, but I was very nervous.” During difficult scenes, she continued, Fassbender’s support was “a big part of me daring to go all the way.” But Fassbender says it was she who pushed him to be better: “I was kind of scared when Alicia came—she was so fierce and hungry,” he told reporters. “I really felt like I had to get my shit together . . . and be as present as she was.” Behold, the acting equivalent of, “No, I love you more!”</p>

                  <p>“What I saw was two great people who were so supportive of each other, who were really picking each other up and pushing each other,” The Light Between Oceans director Derek Cianfrance told Vanity Fair of watching Vikbender blossom on set. “Michael and Alicia, they were like Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. They were going to make one another better. And they were better together.” In a decade together, why has no one compared my husband and me to Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?</p>
